# GitDemo

This repository now contains a small Python project intended for learning
and executing common algorithms.  The code is organised in a simple
package so you can add new algorithms as you learn them.

## Structure

```
algorithms/
    sorting/
        bubble_sort.py
    searching/
        binary_search.py
```

`main.py` demonstrates how to run the available algorithms from the
command line.  Feel free to extend the `algorithms` package with your own
implementations.
